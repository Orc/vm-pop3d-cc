Jeremy C. Reed <reed@reedmedia.net> is the maintainer of virtualmail-pop3d.
(vm-pop3d is a fork of the gnu-pop3d project.) Previously, he developed
ten patches for gnu-pop3d which were widely used, but never integrated.

=== The following is the original AUTHORS file for gnu-pop3d 0.9.8 ===

Jakob 'sparky' Kaivo <jkaivo@nodomainname.net> is the original and primary
author of GNU POP, as well as the maintainer.

Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org> has been invaluable in helping to test
code and make improvements, including the addition of the CAPA command, the
idea of using the message struct rather than several different arrays, and
several memory use issues. He has also helped keep things up to snuff with
RFCs, and contributed the Debian package stuff and man page. He also looks
over code before release to make sure I didn't miss anything <g> and lots of
other work.

Oscar Wahlberg <oscar.wahlberg@connecta.se> contributed APOP and some other
improvements.

Edgard Castro <castro@usmatrix.net> contributed a much better gnu-pop3d.spec
file (for RedHat RPM) than the original, as well as a new gnu-pop3d.init script
and PAM support.

Mike Klinkert <michael@cs.vu.nl> contributed the code for opening alternatvie
mailboxes (such as might be created by procmail).

Daniel Bergstrom <noa@melody.se> contributed some improvements for PAM support
and autoconf.

R. Soderberg <occupant@coldflame.net> contributed various autoconf fixes and
improvements.
