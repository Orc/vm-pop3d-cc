Installation is relatively simple. Follow these steps:

1)	Run `./configure`. This will create the Makefile and detect your system
	headers. Virtual users support is enabled by default. (Use
	--disable-virtual to disable.) For IP-based virtual domains support,
	see instructions below. (If you want extra debugging output, use
	configure with --enable-debug.) If PAM is available, it is enabled
	by default; it can be disabled with --disable-pam.

2)	If you are using procmail or something similar to deliver mail to a
	nonstandard mailbox location (e.g. $HOME/Mail/inbox) edit the file
	config.h and define MAILSPOOLHOME appropriately.

3)	Run `make` to build. If all goes well, you can run `make install` to
	install.

4)	If you want to run in inetd mode, edit your inetd.conf file
	to point to the program (usually /usr/local/sbin/vm-pop3d unless you
	specified something else with `./configure --prefix`). Some examples:

  pop stream tcp  nowait  root /usr/libexec/tcpd /usr/local/sbin/vm-pop3d

  pop-3  stream tcp nowait.50 root /usr/sbin/vm-pop3d vm-pop3d -i

	The "pop" or "pop-3" part is the service name as defined in your
	/etc/services file. Be sure to read the inetd.conf manual page
	for further information. Then restart inetd with a SIGHUP.

        If you are using xinetd, then maybe use a configuration like:

	 service pop-3
	 {
        	 socket_type     = stream
	         protocol        = tcp
	         wait            = no
	         user            = root
       		 instances       = 25
		 server          = /usr/sbin/vm-pop3d
	         server_args     = -i
	         log_type        = SYSLOG local4 info
        	 log_on_success  = PID HOST EXIT DURATION
	         log_on_failure  = HOST ATTEMPT
	 }


	You can run vm-pop3d without superuser privileges via inetd,
	by setting inetd's user and group field configuration.

	Command-line options for --user and --group are available;
	You can use the user (or group) name or UID (or GID) number.
	The group is for overriding the "mail" default which the POP3
	server will run as. The user setting is for overriding the
	compiled-in UID used for the virtual domains. An inetd example:

  pop-3-test      stream  tcp     nowait  vmpop   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/pkg/sbin/vm-pop3d --user vmpop --group vmmail --debug=9

5)	If you are running in standalone, you should add vm-pop3d to
	your start up scripts. A sample init script is available
	(vm-pop3d.init). For example, copy it to /etc/rc.d/init.d/vm-pop3d
	(or appropriate location) and make it executable.

	If you use System V-type scripts, then use chkconfig, update-rc.d
	or ntsysv (or create the symlinks manually) to point to the
	startup script (maybe at /etc/rc.d/init.d/pop3d).

	If you choose to run as a daemon, make sure your xinetd (or inetd)
	doesn't refer to POP3; for example, edit /etc/inetd.conf to
	remove or comment out any lines that start POP3 servers.

6)	If using PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) support, then you
	may need to setup /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d/vm-pop3d with the
	information from the included vm-pop3d.pamd file. Some operating
	systems that offer PAM, such as Debian Linux and FreeBSD, provide
	already working defaults. Note that PAM is only used for the
	regular system accounts and not the virtual accounts.

7)	Be sure to read the vm-pop3d manual page.

8)	For "Frequently asked questions" read the FAQ.

== Virtual Domains Support ==

virtualmail-pop3d allows use of separate password files and spool
directories for each virtual domain.

This will allow you to have multiple users with the same name
on one system. Well... they aren't really users, just mailboxes.

For example, you can use the Exim MTA to deliver the mail in
the correct spool hierarchy. You can use whatever you want to
put the mail in the right place; just make sure it is readable
and writable by the program.

Then the end-user, enters his/her username AND domain name
as the username in the pop3 mail client separated by an
At sign "@" or a colon ":". (The colon is because Netscape
Messenger pre-parses the username before sending to the
pop3 server.)

This virtual users support is enabled by default. Use --disable-virtual
(with ./configure) to disable this capability.

You can also enable IP-based support with ./configure's
 --enable-ip-based-virtual. (Or you can also define the config.h option
"IP_BASED_VIRTUAL".) This feature will will select the password file
and mail spool directory by the hostname that the user chooses to connect
to. (Of course, with this option, you will need separate IPs for each
virtual domain and the IP must resolve to the chosen host name.)

If the user enters the domain name with his username,
it will override the IP-based option.

Some default settings that you may need to change in vm-pop3d.h:

- VIRTUAL_UID is the UID of the owner (real Unix account) of the
  virtual mailboxes. 
- VIRTUAL_MAILPATH is the path to the sub-directories containing
   the mailboxes for each virtual domain (or realm). It has a host,
   domain or realm name as a sub-directory which contain the mailbox
   files; for example: /var/spool/virtual/foo.bar/username where
   "username" is the mailbox name. (By default, this is
   /var/spool/virtual.) At this time, the mailboxes are the standard
   Unix/Berkeley mbox format.
- VIRTUAL_PASSWORDS_PATH is the first part (or prefix) of the path to
  the sub-directories containing the password files for each virtual
  domain. (By default, this is /etc/virtual/.)
- VIRTUAL_PASSWORD_FNAME is the file name (or suffix) for the virtual
  domain's password file. (By default, this is "passwd". It could be set
  to "mail/mailboxes", for example.) The full path to this password file
  is built by concatenating
   VIRTUAL_PASSWORDS_PATH "/" domainname "/" VIRTUAL_PASSWORD_FNAME
  where domainname is the name of the virtual host/realm that the
  virtual user is a part of.

The password file is:

username:ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD

They are located like:

/etc/virtual/domainname/passwd
/etc/virtual/poptest.reedmedia.net/passwd
/etc/virtual/foo.bar/passwd

The mail spool looks like something like this:

/var/spool/virtual/domainname/jeremy
/var/spool/virtual/domainname/somename
/var/spool/virtual/poptest.reedmedia.net/jeremy
/var/spool/virtual/poptest.reedmedia.net/somename
/var/spool/virtual/foo.bar/jeremy
/var/spool/virtual/foo.bar/somename
